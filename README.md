These lists contain all the commands I have learned for the R courses.

It includes 3 files:
  1. Command-list.R: This list contains the commands and a small explanation of the use of it.
  2. Packages-list.R: This list contains the different Packages used or mentioned during the courses.
  3. R-Markdown.R: This list contains the commands needed to build Markdown files for report and reading.
